This project compares prostate cancer characteristics in transgender females (TF) and cisgender males (CM).

Research questions of the dashboard: 
-	Do serum PSA levels differ among TF and CM at prostate cancer diagnosis? (Plotly bar chart, PSA levels)
-	Does grade of prostate cancer at diagnosis differ among TF and CM? (Plotly bar chart, Gleason scores) 
-	How does stage at diagnosis vary over time among cohort members? (Highcharter line chart)
