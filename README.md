This dashboard contains visualizations for a thesis that compares prostate cancer 
characteristics in transgender females (TF) and cisgender males (CM). Due to the 
confidential nature of the data used in the thesis, a mock dataset is created to 
simulate the thesis data. 

**Research questions of the dashboard**
-	Do serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels differ among TF and CM at prostate cancer diagnosis? (Figure 1)
-	Does grade of prostate cancer at diagnosis differ among TF and CM? (Figure 2) 
-	How does stage at diagnosis vary over time among cohort members? (Figure 3)

**Real-world impact**

A primary issue in transgender health is access to transgender-specific healthcare, 
including age- and natal sex-specific cancer screening and monitoring of risk factors. 
This study intends fill a gap in understanding prostate cancer characteristics among TF, 
and provide evidence of the need for increased access to transgender healthcare and the 
need for physicians to better educate transwomen about monitoring prostate health.
